# vba-automateemail

Hello all,

I am currently working as a civil engineer and I have a task to send multiple emails to my clients for a new quotation if there are any updates to the design provided by the architects.

Scenario
1. Clients that have not replied with any quotations -> If there are any amendments, the VBA code will track the latest email with the company name provided in the email body and the email with the latest amendment will be sent on top of the thread.

2. Clients that have replied with a quotation -> If there are any amendments, the VBA code will track the latest email/reply from the company with the company name provided in the email body and resend the email on top of the thread.
